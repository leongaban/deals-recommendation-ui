# Recommendation Engine

A Digital API that will interface with QO  and BI to request, retrieve, and pass for display recommendations on the upsell page and in-cart upsell. :D

The Recommendation Engine allows us to move towards personalization of recommendations offered to customers (analytics captured during Phase I for cart products selected)
